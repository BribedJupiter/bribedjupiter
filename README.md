My name's Jack and I'm currently a university student at The University of Kansas studying computer science. I'm interested in all forms of software engineering, but 
I'm particularly interested in API backends and graphics programming. I love digging in to the technical nuts and bolts of a problem and designing 
systems and solutions in complex and dynamic environments. <bn>

Most of my experience is in Java, C++, C, and Python. I'm familiar with the software lifecycle, and I enjoy writing a good test. Related to industry, I've used and am familiar with a variety of tools, libraries, and build systems. Some examples include Maven, Docker, Git, JUnit / Mockito, and graphics frameworks such as LibGDX, Raylib and now I'm learning OpenGL. Feel free to look through my GitHub at some of my projects. My favorite is [Morroscape](https://github.com/BribedJupiter/Morroscape) which is a C++ based game project where I've implemented the Bullet3 physics library and am now working on networking.  

Overall, I'd say I'm a passionate and driven student who loves to think big, work with others, and build great software.
